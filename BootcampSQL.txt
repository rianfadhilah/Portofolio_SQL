Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000 total rows
ii. Business table = 10000 total rows
iii. Category table = 10000 total rows
iv. Checkin table = 10000 total rows
v. elite_years table = 10000 total rows
vi. friend table = 10000 total rows
vii. hours table = 10000 total rows
viii. photo table = 10000 total rows
ix. review table = 10000 total rows
x. tip table = 10000 total rows
xi. user table = 10000 total rows
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.
Business = 

i. Business = 10,000
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review = 10,000
vi. Checkin =  493
vii. Photo = 10,000
viii. Tip = 537
ix. User = 10,000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	Based the data i have, posing more reviews doesn't make users automatically have more fans. yes the most user who posting review have
	most fans but many user who dont make many review as others also have more fans compared to those who make more reviews. for example:
	rebeca only post 6 reviews and have 69 fans compared addy who make 110 reviews but only have 36 fans

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer:
	the answer is "love:
	word "love" have 1780 total review
	word "hate" only have  232 total review
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	i use two query
	1 .select 
	   text
	   from Review
	   where text like "%love%"

	2 .select 
	   text
	   from Review
	   where text like "%hate%"
	
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	select 
	Name,
	Fans
	from User
	order by fans desc
	limit 10
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
+-----------+------+
| name      | fans |
+-----------+------+
| Amy       |  503 |
| Mimi      |  497 |

+-----------+------+
	
		

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
yes, most 4-5 stars group have longer distribution of hours that the most other group

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
yes,  4-5 stars group have more review count that other group
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
no data to make analysis about location between there two groups
SQL code used for analysis:

select
b.city,
c.category,
case
when b.stars >=2 and b.stars <=3 then '2-3 stars'
when b.stars >=4 and b.stars <=5 then '4-5 stars'
else 'other'
end starts,
b.review_count,
b.neighborhood,
h.hours
from (Business as b 
inner join category as c
on c.Business_id = b.id)
inner join hours as h
on h.Business_id = b.id
where city == "Mesa"
group by stars
order by stars desc

		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
	the group who still open have more review count than the group who already closed
         
ii. Difference 2:
	the group who still open get more stars than the group who already closed
         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT AVG(stars), AVG(review_count), is_open, COUNT(id),
COUNT(c.count) as Checkings
FROM business b
LEFT JOIN checkin c
ON b.id = c.business_id
GROUP BY is_open
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         finding the state who have most type business category who still open
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
		i need join two table (business and catagory), then i need filter just for the business who still open. after that 
		i will group the table by state column and make order by result (count(category)) so i can have the state who have most type business category who still open
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
  +-------+-------+
| state | total |
+-------+-------+
| AZ    |   179 |
| ON    |   134 |
| NV    |    84 |
| OH    |    71 |
| NC    |    41 |
| WI    |    19 |
| PA    |    18 |
| BW    |    13 |
| QC    |     7 |
| EDH   |     6 |
| HLD   |     2 |
+-------+-------+       
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:
select
b.state,
count(c.category) as result
from business as b
inner join category as c
on c.Business_id = b.id
where is_open == "1"
group by state
order by result desc
